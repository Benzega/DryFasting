## About this protocol

This dry fasting protocol was adapted from the book "The Phoenix Protocol" by August Dunning. Read the book and/or watch the author's videos if you wish to understand the protocol, the science and the methods better.

**Important: This protocol can be adjusted for shorter fasting periods (i.e. 1-3-5 day)**

## Pre-fast (6-12 hours before starting)

A dry fast can ultimately be undertaken without any specific preperations. Here's a list of optional pre-fast recommendations to make the transition into the fast, and the duration of the fast easier and more tolerable.

**Optional pre-fast preperations:**

- Stop eating large meals.
- Eat a large portion of watermelon.
- Drink 2-3 liters of coconut water.
- Load up on potassium and magnesium.
- Directly before starting the fast, take a 200-300% dose of edible, activated charcoal.

## The dry fast

**NOTE: Longer dry fasts (5+ days) should not performed more than once every 6 months.**

- A dry fast involves simply **not eating and not drinking** for the duration of the fast.
- **You do not need to dry fast for the full 7 days.** You can choose a duration you're comfortable with.
- You **should not peform** **streneous exercise** during the dry fast, although practitioners are encouraged to do daily 30-minute walks.
- **You may brush your teeth** using water during the fast, but be careful not to swallow any amount of liquid. Spit thouroughly and dry the inside of your mouth out with a cloth or t-shirt.
- **You may shower or otherwise touch water during the fast.** You just can't swallow any liquid.
- Mildy discomforts including mild fevers are expected during longer dry fasts. Your body is killing parasites and other bad bacteria.

So sit back, relax, watch TV, listen to books, sleep and enjoy your dry fast!

**Some tips:**
- Boredom can be difficult to cope with during a fast. Make sure you have an ample supply of movies, shows or other amusements to keep you occupied.
- Sleep as much as humanely possible.
- Cold showers feel great.


## Post-fast (re-feeding)

**IMPORTANT: Follow the re-feeding instructions carefully - especially for the first 24 hours. DO NOT jump into solid food immediately or you risk becoming sick. Your body is delicate. We need to wake up your digestion systems slowly.**

### How long should re-feeding take?

Re-feeding should last the same number of days that the fast did. If you fasted for 5 days, it should take you roughly 5 days to get back to normal.

### Notes about post-fast enemas

If you fast for longer than 5 days, it is recommended to perform 1-2 post-fast enemas to fully clean out your system. I choose to perform these on days 1 and 3 during the post-fast phase, although some practitioners choose alternative enema schedules (i.e. days 2, 3).

If you fast for less than 3 days, it is not necessary to perform an enema.

**Notes**

- Only use a medical grade enema kit.
- Research how to perform an enema prior to doing so.

**How to perpare a basic salt water enema solution**

- Mix 3-4 cups of warm water with 2 teaspoons of table salt.

### Notes about food during re-feeding

During the entire re-feeding stage, you want to focus on only eating whole, easily digestible, alkaline foods. You'll want to generally avoid the following categories...

**Avoid:**

- Processed
- Carbs
- Sugars
- Fructoses
- Acids
- Spices
- Meat

**Some foods you can eat:**

- Bone broth
- Steamed vegetables
- Hard-boiled eggs
- Scrambled eggs, no oil
- Fresh fruit in small doses
- Salads, soups and broths. (No tomatoes or spices)
- Certain fermented foods

### Step 1: Break the fast

- **Sip over 1 hour:** 1/2 liter of water + 1 tsp. baking soda.
- **Sip over 2 hours:** 1 liter of coconut water.
- **Sip over 1 hour:** 1/2 liter of sparkling mineral water + a dissolved liquid/powder multi-vitamin.
- **Sip over 1 hour:** 1 liter of bone broth.
- Dissolve a probiotic in water and drink.
- **Perform an enema (Optional: See above *Notes about post-fast enemas*)**

- Continue to sip more water and bone broth.

### Step 2: Re-feeding (days 2-3)

You can sip liquids more liberally after the first 24 hours but we still need to be careful about ingesting solid food. On days 2 and 3, we're taking in more liquid and starting to move into easily digestible foods like blended soups and even some vegetables.

#### Day 2

- Drink 1-2 liters of coconut water throughout the day.
- Drink 1/2 liter of sparkling mineral water + a dissolved liquid/powder multi-vitamin.
- Dissolve a probiotic in water and drink.
- 1 liter of bone broth.
- Drink 2-4 glasses of water.
- **Optional:** Fully blend vegetables (peppers, carrots, cauliflower, spinach) with water into a soup and sip gently.

#### Day 3

Do the same steps as day 2.

- **Perform an enema (Optional: See above *Notes about post-fast enemas*)**
- **Optional:** Prepare some steamed cauliflower. Chew slowly and thouroughly.

### Step 3: Re-feeding (days 4-7)

**Perform this routine daily:**

- Drink 1-2 liters of coconut water throughout the day.
- Drink 1/2 liter of sparkling mineral water + a dissolved liquid/powder multi-vitamin.
- Dissolve a probiotic in water and drink.
- 1 liter of bone broth.
- Drink 2-4 glasses of water.

**You can also start to introduce solid foods...**

- Bone broth
- Steamed vegetables
- Hard-boiled eggs
- Scrambled eggs, no oil
- Fresh fruit in small doses
- Salads, soups and broths. (No tomatoes or spices)
- Certain fermented foods
- Small portions of meat

**However remember to try and avoid these foods...**

- Processed
- Carbs
- Sugars
- Fructoses
- Acids
- Spices

## Completed (day 8 and beyond)

After you've completed the re-feeding stage, it's still important to maintain a healthy diet. Try and avoid going back to processed junk food.
